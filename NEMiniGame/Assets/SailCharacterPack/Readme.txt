Thanks for buying the Sail Character Pack!

***************************

This package contains the following:

--Static Textured Models:
	Small Fish
--Rigged, Animated, and Textured Models:
	Character (with 3 texture variants)
		Idle, Happy, Sad, Suprised, and "Throw Fish" animations
	Squid
		Appear and Float Animations
	Seagull
		Fly Animation
--Environment Textures:
	Rock
	Grass
	Water
	Sky (top and side)
--Blender Source Files
--UV Templates (.png)
--Facial Animation Script
--Demonstration Scene

***************************

To create your own characters, simply use the included Character_UV.png template to make
a texture. Then, create two materials, one for the body and one for the face, each using
the same texture. Drag the Character prefab into the scene, set the two materials in the
Skinned Mesh Renderer component (it's in the child "Character" GameObject) to your custom
materials (body first, then face), and you're done!
